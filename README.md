# Phone Contact

## 1- Brief definition:

**Phone Contact** is an Open Source project. An API created with Java Framework Spring Boot to manage your contact in your portable computer.

Sometimes, if you are a star just like me, it is better to back up of all your contacts in your phone and that is why _**Phone Contact**_ was created. Because loosing your contact can lead you to loose many opportunities.
This API is for everyone who want to create a Contact web application.
